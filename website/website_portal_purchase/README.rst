Website Portal for Purchases
============================

This module adds the partner's purchase documents in the frontend portal.
Suppliers will be able to see the list and state of their request for
quotations, purchase orders and supplier invoices.

.. warning::
    "Purchases" term here refers to your company's POV about purchases. That
    means this module actually creates a portal *for your suppliers*.

Known issues / Roadmap
----------------------











* Tests.
* When migrating to v10, we will have to base this module on ``website_portal``
  directly.
* If you want to display invoices, you will have to install
  ``website_portal_sale_v10``, which displays both customer and supplier
  invoices merged in the same place.

  * If you do not want both kinds of invoices merged in the same controller,
    install ``website_portal_invoice_separated``.
