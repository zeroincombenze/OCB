Connect with experts, follow what interests you, share documents and promote
============================================================================
best practices with Odoo <a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/enterprise-social-network">Enterprise Social Network</a>. Get work done with
effective collaboration across departments, geographies, documents and business
applications. All of this while decreasing email overload.

Connect with experts

Next time you have a question for the marketing, sales, R&D or any other
department, don't send an email blast-post the question to Odoo and get answers
from the right persons.

Follow what interests you

Want to get informed about new product features, hot deals, bottlenecks in
projects or any other event? Just follow what interests you to get the
information you need what you need; no more, no less.

Get Things Done

You can process (not only read) the inbox and easily mark messages for future
actions. Start feeling the pleasure of having an empty inbox every day; no more
overload of information.

Promote best practices

Cut back on meetings and email chains by working together in groups of
interests. Create a group to let people share files, discuss ideas, and vote to
promote best practices.

Improve Access to Information and Expertise

Break down information silos. Search across your existing systems to find the
answers and expertise you need to complete projects quickly.

Collaborate securely

Set the right security policy; public, private or on invitation only --
according to the information sensitivity.

A Twitter-like Network For Your Company

Make every employee feel more connected and engaged with twitter-like features
for your own company. Follow people, share best practices, 'like' top ideas,
etc.
