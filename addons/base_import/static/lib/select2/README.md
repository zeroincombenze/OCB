Select2
=======

Select2 is a jQuery-based replacement for select boxes. It supports searching, remote data sets, and infinite scrolling of results.

To get started, checkout examples and documentation at http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2

Use cases

* Enhancing native selects with search.
* Enhancing native selects with a better multi-select interface.
* Loading data from JavaScript: easily load items via ajax and have them searchable.
* Nesting optgroups: native selects only support one level of nested. Select2 does not have this restriction.
* Tagging: ability to add new items on the fly.
* Working with large, remote datasets: ability to partially load a dataset based on the search term.
* Paging of large datasets: easy support for loading more pages when the results are scrolled to the end.
* Templating: support for custom rendering of results and selections.

Browser compatibility
* IE 8+
* Chrome 8+
* Firefox 10+
* Safari 3+
* Opera 10.6+

Internationalization (i18n)

Select2 supports multiple languages by simply including the right
language JS file (`select2_locale_it.js`, `select2_locale_nl.js`, etc.).

Missing a language? Just copy `select2_locale_en.js.template`, translate
it, and make a pull request back to Select2 here on GitHub.
