===========================

DESCRIPTION

Firefox, Safari and Opera 9 support the canvas tag to allow 2D command-based 
drawing operations. ExplorerCanvas brings the same functionality to Internet 
Explorer; web developers only need to include a single script tag in their 
existing canvas webpages to enable this support.


INSTALLATION

Include the ExplorerCanvas tag in the same directory as your HTML files, and 
add the following code to your page, preferably in the <head> tag.

<!--[if IE]><script type="text/javascript" src="excanvas.js"></script><![endif]-->

If you run into trouble, please look at the included example code to see how
to best implement this
