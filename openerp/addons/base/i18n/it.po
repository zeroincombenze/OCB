#: model:ir.module.module,description:base.module_account_banking_reconciliation
msgid ""
"\n"
"\n"
"This module is designed to provide an easy method in which OpenERP\n"
"accounting users can manually reconcile/validate their financial\n"
"transactions from their financial institution/transaction providers\n"
"(e.g. Paypal, A financial institution, google wallet, etc) against\n"
"OpenERP GL Chart of Account bank accounts.\n"
"\n"
"Users will be able to validate and indicate if a transaction has\n"
"\"Cleared the Bank\" using a checkmark on a new Reconcile Financial\n"
"Account Statement view on each individual financial transaction.\n"
"Users will also be able to mark transactions on a bank account for\n"
"future research.\n"
"\n"
"The idea is that as a first step users will manually look at their\n"
"paper statement and line-by-line check off which financial\n"
"transactions have cleared the bank in OpenERP using the new Bank\n"
"Reconciliation Wizard. These changes will be displayed on the  new\n"
"Reconcile Financial Account Statement tree view screen. This is the\n"
"process in which many companies reconcile (aka Audit) their bank\n"
"account statements and accounting system today and represents good\n"
"segregation of duties\n"
"\n"
"Users can save their in-process reconciliations.\n"
"\n"
"BACKGROUND\n"
"Using the search view filters - users will also be able to effectively\n"
"sort, filter the transactions on a particular GL Financial Account.\n"
"This new screen will display the journal items associated with a\n"
"particular bank account. Several of the field labels have been\n"
"relabeled to a more common vernacular.\n"
"\n"
"(Future) Phase II of the project - will extend this module to include\n"
"a wizard to pre-filter the tree view, and include additional reports\n"
"for accountants. And include the ability to execute quick entry of\n"
"common statement related transactions such as recording bank service\n"
"fees (an Expense), and Interest Income Earned on the bank account\n"
"(Income), when allowed by law. Often, companies will print their\n"
"reconciliation, staple it to their bank statement and file the documents\n"
"for future review and audit.\n"
"\n"
"(Future) Phase III of the project will extend this module to include\n"
"more information to add further clarity throughout OpenERP for financial\n"
"transactions, and include the ability to quickly compare an imported bank"
"\n"
"statement with a GL Bank Account's recorded transaction, including\n"
"autoreconciling them - and providing the information available for review"
"\n"
"\n"
"The need for this module is driven by the following:\n"
"OpenERP's default functionality doesn't support the typical \"BANK\" "
"account\n"
"reconciliation process found in many countries (e.g. the US)\n"
"\n"
"Users want to easily record whether bank transactions sent to their bank\n"
"have \"cleared the bank\"- definition of \"cleared the bank\":  presented"
" to\n"
"the bank for payment and paid by the bank - added/subtracted funds on\n"
"a bank account.\n"
"\n"
"Users want the ability to validate if the bank processed the transactions"
"\n"
"them correctly (e.g. properly encoded transaction - e.g. company sent a\n"
"payment of $20.20 to the bank. Was it processed for $20.20?). This can\n"
"be considered \"Auditing the bank statement\". We don't assume the bank\n"
"correctly processed any transaction.\n"
"\n"
"Users want to understand what payments they've made are still outstanding"
"\n"
"and have not been paid by the bank.\n"
"The financial auditing segregation standard of separating the duties of:\n"
"recording customer payments and making deposits; recording supplier "
"payments\n"
"and writing checks; and monitoring bank account activity. This "
"segregation\n"
"of duties is necessary to monitor and help prevent fraud.\n"
"\n"
"Assumptions:\n"
"1. Companies using OpenERP have setup a One-to-one relationship between\n"
"   their bank accounts and their OpenERP GL accounts. Each bank account\n"
"   should have a corresponding GL account that is not shared with another"
"\n"
"   account.\n"
"\n"
"    Example:\n"
"\n"
"    OpenERP GL Account #        Corresponding Bank Account\n"
"    10100                Bank (AR) Account Checking 5434\n"
"                         (held at Institution A)\n"
"    10200                Master Bank Account 2343 (held at Institution A)"
"\n"
"    10300                Bank Payable Account Checking  5678\n"
"                         (held at Institution A)\n"
"    10400                Bank Payroll Account 6656 (held at Institution "
"B)\n"
"    10500                Paypal Account 3343 (held at Paypal)\n"
"    10600                Google Wallet Account 6788\n"
"    10700                AMEX Corporate Card Account 9989\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"2. Companies have included a Non-Deposited Funds Account in their GL "
"account\n"
"   (typically in current assets in their bank account areas). This "
"account\n"
"   is used to store payments that have been recorded in OpenERP - but not"
"\n"
"   yet deposited into the financial institution. (NOTE: this account is\n"
"   important to have if the user \"batches check deposits\"- which is the"
"\n"
"   process of making a large single deposits of customer payment into the"
"\n"
"   bank (e.g. $20,000USD), but it is made up of smaller checks\n"
"   (e.g. 20 checks of $1,000 each). Many banks just record the total "
"deposit\n"
"   amount ($20,000) and don￢ﾀﾙt provide the breakdown of the individual\n"
"   checks that make up the larger deposit. This setup approach enables "
"users\n"
"   to drill down and see the individual checks that make up a larger "
"deposit.\n"
"\n"
"Recommendations:\n"
"From a cash management and financial control perspective it is "
"recommended\n"
"that users establish the following four(4) bank accounts at their "
"financial\n"
"institution at a minimum to handle financial transactions.\n"
"(NOTE: we recommend users place the last 4 digits of their bank account "
"in\n"
"the GL account name of the account. It helps accountants in their "
"management\n"
"of the system):\n"
"\n"
"Bank (AR) Account Checking 5434\n"
"This is a checking account designated as the account where payments made "
"to\n"
"the company are deposited (e.g. a customer payment made by check is\n"
"deposited here, or a customer paying by electronic transaction EFT/ACH is"
"\n"
"deposited into this GL).\n"
"\n"
"Master Bank Account 2343\n"
"This is the master account in which the company keeps the majority of "
"their\n"
"funds. Often with the most limited access.\n"
"\n"
"Bank Payable Account Checking  5678\n"
"This is a checking account designated for the company to pay their "
"expenses\n"
"from. (e.g. Company writes a check to pay a supplier for their office\n"
"supplies).\n"
"\n"

"This module is designed to provide an easy method in which OpenERP\n"
"accounting users can manually reconcile/validate their financial\n"
"transactions from their financial institution/transaction providers\n"
"(e.g. Paypal, A financial institution, google wallet, etc) against\n"
"OpenERP GL Chart of Account bank accounts.\n"
"\n"
"Users will be able to validate and indicate if a transaction has\n"
"\"Cleared the Bank\" using a checkmark on a new Reconcile Financial\n"
"Account Statement view on each individual financial transaction.\n"
"Users will also be able to mark transactions on a bank account for\n"
"future research.\n"
"\n"
"The idea is that as a first step users will manually look at their\n"
"paper statement and line-by-line check off which financial\n"
"transactions have cleared the bank in OpenERP using the new Bank\n"
"Reconciliation Wizard. These changes will be displayed on the  new\n"
"Reconcile Financial Account Statement tree view screen. This is the\n"
"process in which many companies reconcile (aka Audit) their bank\n"
"account statements and accounting system today and represents good\n"
"segregation of duties\n"
"\n"
"Users can save their in-process reconciliations.\n"
"\n"
"BACKGROUND\n"
"Using the search view filters - users will also be able to effectively\n"
"sort, filter the transactions on a particular GL Financial Account.\n"
"This new screen will display the journal items associated with a\n"
"particular bank account. Several of the field labels have been\n"
"relabeled to a more common vernacular.\n"
"\n"
"(Future) Phase II of the project - will extend this module to include\n"
"a wizard to pre-filter the tree view, and include additional reports\n"
"for accountants. And include the ability to execute quick entry of\n"
"common statement related transactions such as recording bank service\n"
"fees (an Expense), and Interest Income Earned on the bank account\n"
"(Income), when allowed by law. Often, companies will print their\n"
"reconciliation, staple it to their bank statement and file the documents\n"
"for future review and audit.\n"
"\n"
"(Future) Phase III of the project will extend this module to include\n"
"more information to add further clarity throughout OpenERP for financial\n"
"transactions, and include the ability to quickly compare an imported bank"
"\n"
"statement with a GL Bank Account's recorded transaction, including\n"
"autoreconciling them - and providing the information available for review"
"\n"
"\n"
"The need for this module is driven by the following:\n"
"OpenERP's default functionality doesn't support the typical \"BANK\" "
"account\n"
"reconciliation process found in many countries (e.g. the US)\n"
"\n"
"Users want to easily record whether bank transactions sent to their bank\n"
"have \"cleared the bank\"- definition of \"cleared the bank\":  presented"
" to\n"
"the bank for payment and paid by the bank - added/subtracted funds on\n"
"a bank account.\n"
"\n"
"Users want the ability to validate if the bank processed the transactions"
"\n"
"them correctly (e.g. properly encoded transaction - e.g. company sent a\n"
"payment of $20.20 to the bank. Was it processed for $20.20?). This can\n"
"be considered \"Auditing the bank statement\". We don't assume the bank\n"
"correctly processed any transaction.\n"
"\n"
"Users want to understand what payments they've made are still outstanding"
"\n"
"and have not been paid by the bank.\n"
"The financial auditing segregation standard of separating the duties of:\n"
"recording customer payments and making deposits; recording supplier "
"payments\n"
"and writing checks; and monitoring bank account activity. This "
"segregation\n"
"of duties is necessary to monitor and help prevent fraud.\n"
"\n"
"Assumptions:\n"
"1. Companies using OpenERP have setup a One-to-one relationship between\n"
"   their bank accounts and their OpenERP GL accounts. Each bank account\n"
"   should have a corresponding GL account that is not shared with another"
"\n"
"   account.\n"
"\n"
"    Example:\n"
"\n"
"    OpenERP GL Account #        Corresponding Bank Account\n"
"    10100                Bank (AR) Account Checking 5434\n"
"                         (held at Institution A)\n"
"    10200                Master Bank Account 2343 (held at Institution A)"
"\n"
"    10300                Bank Payable Account Checking  5678\n"
"                         (held at Institution A)\n"
"    10400                Bank Payroll Account 6656 (held at Institution "
"B)\n"
"    10500                Paypal Account 3343 (held at Paypal)\n"
"    10600                Google Wallet Account 6788\n"
"    10700                AMEX Corporate Card Account 9989\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"2. Companies have included a Non-Deposited Funds Account in their GL "
"account\n"
"   (typically in current assets in their bank account areas). This "
"account\n"
"   is used to store payments that have been recorded in OpenERP - but not"
"\n"
"   yet deposited into the financial institution. (NOTE: this account is\n"
"   important to have if the user \"batches check deposits\"- which is the"
"\n"
"   process of making a large single deposits of customer payment into the"
"\n"
"   bank (e.g. $20,000USD), but it is made up of smaller checks\n"
"   (e.g. 20 checks of $1,000 each). Many banks just record the total "
"deposit\n"
"   amount ($20,000) and don￢ﾀﾙt provide the breakdown of the individual\n"
"   checks that make up the larger deposit. This setup approach enables "
"users\n"
"   to drill down and see the individual checks that make up a larger "
"deposit.\n"
"\n"
"Recommendations:\n"
"From a cash management and financial control perspective it is "
"recommended\n"
"that users establish the following four(4) bank accounts at their "
"financial\n"
"institution at a minimum to handle financial transactions.\n"
"(NOTE: we recommend users place the last 4 digits of their bank account "
"in\n"
"the GL account name of the account. It helps accountants in their "
"management\n"
"of the system):\n"
"\n"
"Bank (AR) Account Checking 5434\n"
"This is a checking account designated as the account where payments made "
"to\n"
"the company are deposited (e.g. a customer payment made by check is\n"
"deposited here, or a customer paying by electronic transaction EFT/ACH is"
"\n"
"deposited into this GL).\n"
"\n"
"Master Bank Account 2343\n"
"This is the master account in which the company keeps the majority of "
"their\n"
"funds. Often with the most limited access.\n"
"\n"
"Bank Payable Account Checking  5678\n"
"This is a checking account designated for the company to pay their "
"expenses\n"
"from. (e.g. Company writes a check to pay a supplier for their office\n"
"supplies).\n"
"\n"
"Bank Payroll Account 6656\n"
"This is a checking account designated for a company to pay their\n"
"employees and payroll.\n"

"Reports mainly fetch data from account moves, but can also combine data "

"Installation\n"
"============\n"
"\n"
"There is no specific installation procedure for this module.\n"

"Configuration and Usage\n"
"=======================\n"
"\n"
"To configure this module, you need to:\n"
"\n"
"* Go to Accounting > Configuration > Financial Reports > MIS Report "
"Templates\n"
"where you can create report templates by defining KPI's. KPI's constitute"
"\n"
"the rows of your reports. Such report templates are time independent.\n"
"\n"
"* Then in Accounting > Reporting > MIS Reports you can create report "
"instance\n"
"by binding the templates to time period, hence defining the columns of "
"your\n"
"reports.\n"
"\n"
"* From the MIS Report view, you can preview the report, add it to and "
"Odoo\n"
"dashboard, and export it to Excel.\n"
"\n"
"Developer notes\n"
"===============\n"
"\n"
"A typical extension is to provide a mechanism to filter reports on "
"analytic\n"
"dimensions or operational units. To implement this, you can override\n"
"_get_additional_move_line_filter and _get_additional_filter to further\n"
"filter move lines or queries based on a user selection. A typical use "
"case\n"
"could be to add an analytic account field on mis.report.instance, or even"
"\n"
"on mis.report.instance.period if you want different columns to show "
"different\n"
"analytic accounts.\n"
"\n"
"Known issues / Roadmap\n"
"======================\n"
"\n"
"* Add 'Fiscal Year' period type.\n"
"\n"
"* Allow selecting accounts by type. This is currently possible by "
"expressing\n"
"  a query such as balp[][('account_id.user_type.code', '=', ...)].\n"
"  This will work but would be more efficient if one could write balp[\n"
"  user_type=...], as it would involve much less queries to the database.\n"
"\n"
"* More tests should be added. The first part is creating test data, then "
"it\n"
"will be easier. At the minimum, We need the following test data:\n"
"\n"
"  * one account charts with a few normal accounts and view accounts,\n"
"  * two fiscal years,\n"
"  * an opening entry in the second fiscal year,\n"
"  * to test multi-company consolidation, we need a second company with "
"it's own\n"
"    account chart and two fiscal years, but without opening entry; we "

"\n"
"Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.\n"
"===============================================\n"
"This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, "
"and\n"
"will automatically create OpenERP users for them on the fly.\n"
"\n"
"**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` "
"module installed.\n"
"\n"
"Configuration:\n"
"--------------\n"
"After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters "
"in the\n"
"Configuration tab of the Company details. Different companies may have "
"different\n"
"LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be"
" unique\n"
"in OpenERP, even across multiple companies).\n"
"\n"
"Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow "
"it), by\n"
"simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP "
"configuration.\n"
"This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for "
"the master\n"
"LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to"
"\n"
"authenticate it.\n"
"\n"
"Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers "
"supporting\n"
"it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"\n"
"For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf"
"\n"
"manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.\n"
"\n"
"Security Considerations:\n"
"------------------------\n"
"Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the OpenERP database, the LDAP "
"server\n"
"is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of "
"the\n"
"password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.\n"
"\n"
"OpenERP does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of "
"password\n"
"should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for "
"LDAP users).\n"
"\n"
"It is also possible to have local OpenERP users in the database along "
"with\n"
"LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious "
"example).\n"
"\n"
"Here is how it works:\n"
"---------------------\n"
"    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local "
"OpenERP\n"
"      database;\n"
"    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no "
"local\n"
"      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;\n"
"\n"
"As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local OpenERP "
"database\n"
"(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server "
"is\n"
"queried to do the authentication.\n"
"\n"
"Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP "
"server is\n"
"encrypted.\n"
"\n"
"User Template:\n"
"--------------\n"
"In the LDAP configuration on the Company form, it is possible to select a"
" *User\n"
"Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local"
" users\n"
"whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP "
"authentication. This\n"
"allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.\n"
"\n"
"**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password "
"will be\n"
"         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively "

"         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). "
"You\n"
"         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user "

"\n"
"* Filter by account is available in the wizard (no need to go to the\n"
"  Chart of Accounts to do this anymore) or by View account (the report\n"
"  will display all regular children accounts) i.e. you can select all\n"
"  P&L accounts.\n"
"* The report only prints accounts with moves OR with a non\n"
"  null balance. No more endless report with empty accounts (field:\n"
"  display account is hidden)\n"
"* initial balance computation on the fly if no open entry posted\n"
"* Thanks to a new checkbox in the account form, you will have the\n"
"  possibility to centralize any account you like.  This means you do\n"
"  not want to see all entries posted under the account ‘VAT on sales’;\n"
"  you will only see aggregated amounts by periods.\n"
"* Counterpart account is displayed for each transaction (3 accounts max.)"
"\n"
"  to ease searching.\n"
"* Better ergonomy on the wizard: important information is displayed in\n"
"  the top part, filters are in the middle, and options are in the\n"
"  bottom or on a separate tab. There is more specific filtering on\n"
"  separate tabs. No more unique wizard layout for all financial\n"
"  reports (we have removed the journal tab for the GL report)\n"
"* improved report style\n"
"\n"
"The partner ledger: details of entries relative to payable &\n"
"receivable accounts posted in your books sorted by account and\n"
"partner.\n"
"\n"
"* Filter by partner now available\n"
"* Now you can see Accounts then Partner with subtotals for each\n"

"  partner balance for instance. Accounts are ordered in the same way as\n"
"  in the Chart of account\n"
"* Period have been added (date only is not filled in since date can be\n"
"  outside period)\n"
"* Reconciliation code added\n"
"* Subtotal by account\n"
"* Alphabetical sorting (same as in partner balance)\n"
"\n"
"Open invoice report : other version of the partner ledger showing\n"
"unreconciled / partially reconciled entries.\n"

"* Possibility to print unreconciled transactions only at any date in\n"
"  the past (thanks to the new field: `last_rec_date` which computes\n"
"  the last move line reconciliation date). No more pain to get open\n"
"  invoices at the last closing date.\n"
"* no initial balance computed because the report shows open invoices\n"
"  from previous years.\n"
"\n"
"The Trial balance: list of accounts with balances\n"

"* You can either see the columns: initial balance, debit, credit,\n"
"  end balance or compare balances over 4 periods of your choice\n"
"* You can select the \"opening\" filter to get the opening trial balance\n"
"  only\n"
"* If you create an extra virtual chart (using consolidated account) of\n"
"  accounts for your P&L and your balance sheet, you can print your\n"
"  statutory accounts (with comparison over years for instance)\n"
"* If you compare 2 periods, you will get the differences in values and\n"

"Financial Reports - Webkit\n"
"==========================\n"
"\n"
"This module adds or replaces the following standard OpenERP financial "
"reports:\n"
" - General ledger\n"
" - Trial Balance (simple or comparative view)\n"
" - Partner ledger\n"
" - Partner balance\n"
" - Open invoices report\n"
" - Aged Partner Balance\n"
"\n"
"Main improvements per report:\n"
"-----------------------------\n"
"\n"
"The General ledger: details of all entries posted in your books sorted by"
"\n"
"account.\n"
"\n"
"* Filter by account is available in the wizard (no need to go to the\n"
"  Chart of Accounts to do this anymore) or by View account (the report\n"
"  will display all regular children accounts) i.e. you can select all\n"
"  P&L accounts.\n"
"* The report only prints accounts with moves OR with a non\n"
"  null balance. No more endless report with empty accounts (field:\n"
"  display account is hidden)\n"
"* initial balance computation on the fly if no open entry posted\n"
"* Thanks to a new checkbox in the account form, you will have the\n"
"  possibility to centralize any account you like.  This means you do\n"
"  not want to see all entries posted under the account ‘VAT on sales’;\n"
"  you will only see aggregated amounts by periods.\n"
"* Counterpart account is displayed for each transaction (3 accounts max.)"
"\n"
"  to ease searching.\n"
"* Better ergonomy on the wizard: important information is displayed in\n"
"  the top part, filters are in the middle, and options are in the\n"
"  bottom or on a separate tab. There is more specific filtering on\n"
"  separate tabs. No more unique wizard layout for all financial\n"
"  reports (we have removed the journal tab for the GL report)\n"
"* improved report style\n"
"\n"
"The partner ledger: details of entries relative to payable &\n"
"receivable accounts posted in your books sorted by account and\n"
"partner.\n"
"\n"
"* Filter by partner now available\n"
"* Now you can see Accounts then Partner with subtotals for each\n"
"  account allowing you to check you data with trial balance and\n"
"  partner balance for instance. Accounts are ordered in the same way as\n"
"  in the Chart of account\n"
"* Period have been added (date only is not filled in since date can be\n"
"  outside period)\n"
"* Reconciliation code added\n"
"* Subtotal by account\n"
"* Alphabetical sorting (same as in partner balance)\n"
"\n"
"Open invoice report : other version of the partner ledger showing\n"
"unreconciled / partially reconciled entries.\n"
"\n"
"* Possibility to print unreconciled transactions only at any date in\n"
"  the past (thanks to the new field: `last_rec_date` which computes\n"
"  the last move line reconciliation date). No more pain to get open\n"
"  invoices at the last closing date.\n"
"* no initial balance computed because the report shows open invoices\n"
"  from previous years.\n"
"\n"
"The Trial balance: list of accounts with balances\n"
"\n"
"* You can either see the columns: initial balance, debit, credit,\n"
"  end balance or compare balances over 4 periods of your choice\n"
"* You can select the \"opening\" filter to get the opening trial balance\n"
"  only\n"
"* If you create an extra virtual chart (using consolidated account) of\n"
"  accounts for your P&L and your balance sheet, you can print your\n"
"  statutory accounts (with comparison over years for instance)\n"
"* If you compare 2 periods, you will get the differences in values and\n"

"One can decide, per document / attachment, if it should be pushed\n"

"Usage\n"
"-----\n"

" * Speed: priority or economy\n"
" * Type of print: color or black and white\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"You can find them in `Settings > Customization > Low Level Objets > "

"===========================\n"
"\n"
"What is pingen.com\n"
"------------------\n"
"\n"
"Pingen.com is a paid online service.\n"
"It sends uploaded documents by letter post.\n"
"\n"
"Scope of the integration\n"
"------------------------\n"
"\n"
"One can decide, per document / attachment, if it should be pushed\n"
"to pingen.com. The documents are pushed asynchronously.\n"
"\n"
"A second cron updates the informations of the documents from pingen.com, "
"so we\n"
"know which of them have been sent.\n"
"\n"
"Configuration\n"
"-------------\n"
"\n"
"The authentication token is configured on the company's view. You can "
"also\n"
"tick a checkbox if the staging environment (https://stage-api.pingen.com)"
"\n"
"should be used.\n"
"\n"
"The setup of the 2 crons can be changed as well:\n"
"\n"
" * Run Pingen Document Push\n"
" * Run Pingen Document Update\n"
"\n"
"Usage\n"
"-----\n"
"\n"
"On the attachment view, a new pingen.com tab has been added.\n"
"You can tick a box to push the document to pingen.com.\n"
"\n"
"There is 3 additional options:\n"
"\n"
" * Send: the document will not be only uploaded, but will be also be sent"
"\n"
" * Speed: priority or economy\n"
" * Type of print: color or black and white\n"
"\n"
"Once the configuration is done and the attachment saved, a Pingen "
"Document\n"
"is created. You can directly access to the latter on the Link on the "
"right on\n"
"the attachment view.\n"
"\n"
"You can find them in `Settings > Customization > Low Level Objets > "
"Pingen\n"
"Documents` or in the more convenient `Documents` menu if you have "
"installed the\n"
"`document` module.\n"
"\n"
"Errors\n"
"------\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes, pingen.com will refuse to send a document because it does not "
"meet\n"
"its requirements. In such case, the document's state becomes \"Pingen "
"Error\" and\n"
"you will need to manually handle the case, either from the pingen.com "
"backend,\n"
"or by changing the document on OpenERP and resolving the error on the "
"Pingen\n"
"Document.\n"
"\n"
"When a connection error occurs, the action will be retried on the next\n"
"scheduler run.\n"
"\n"
"Dependencies\n"
"------------\n"
"\n"
" * Require the Python library `requests <http://docs.python-"
"requests.org/>`_\n"
" * The PDF files sent to pingen.com have to respect some `formatting "
"rules\n"
"   <https://stage-"
"app.pingen.com/resources/pingen_requirements_v1_en.pdf>`_.\n"
" * The address must be in a format accepted by pingen.com: the last line\n"
"   is the country in English or German.\n"

"the \n"
"creation of the Financial Accounting records). The CODA Bank Statement is"
" a \n"
"'read-only' object, hence remaining a reliable representation of the "

"CODA file whereas the Bank Statement will get modified as required by "

"Statements will also remove those associated statements.\n"

"The following reconciliation logic has been implemented in the CODA "

"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"\n"
"    1) The Company's Bank Account Number of the CODA statement is "
"compared against \n"
"       the Bank Account Number field of the Company's CODA Bank Account \n"
"       configuration records (whereby bank accounts defined in "
"type='info' \n"
"       configuration records are ignored). If this is the case an "
"'internal transfer'\n"
"       transaction is generated using the 'Internal Transfer Account' "
"field of the \n"
"       CODA File Import wizard.\n"
"    2) As a second step the 'Structured Communication' field of the CODA "
"transaction\n"
"       line is matched against the reference field of in- and outgoing "
"invoices \n"
"       (supported : Belgian Structured Communication Type).\n"
"    3) When the previous step doesn't find a match, the transaction "
"counterparty is \n"
"       located via the Bank Account Number configured on the OpenERP "
"Customer and \n"
"       Supplier records.\n"
"    4) In case the previous steps are not successful, the transaction is "
"generated \n"
"       by using the 'Default Account for Unrecognized Movement' field of "
"the CODA \n"
"       File Import wizard in order to allow further manual processing.\n"
"\n"
"In stead of a manual adjustment of the generated Bank Statements, you can"

"creation of the Financial Accounting records). The CODA Bank Statement is"
" a \n"
"'read-only' object, hence remaining a reliable representation of the "
"original\n"
"CODA file whereas the Bank Statement will get modified as required by "
"accounting \n"
"business processes.\n"
"\n"
"CODA Bank Accounts configured as type 'Info' will only generate CODA Bank"
" Statements.\n"
"\n"
"A removal of one object in the CODA processing results in the removal of "
"the \n"
"associated objects. The removal of a CODA File containing multiple Bank \n"
"Statements will also remove those associated statements.\n"
"\n"
"The following reconciliation logic has been implemented in the CODA "
"processing:\n"
"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"\n"
"    1) The Company's Bank Account Number of the CODA statement is "
"compared against \n"
"       the Bank Account Number field of the Company's CODA Bank Account \n"
"       configuration records (whereby bank accounts defined in "
"type='info' \n"
"       configuration records are ignored). If this is the case an "
"'internal transfer'\n"
"       transaction is generated using the 'Internal Transfer Account' "
"field of the \n"
"       CODA File Import wizard.\n"
"    2) As a second step the 'Structured Communication' field of the CODA "
"transaction\n"
"       line is matched against the reference field of in- and outgoing "
"invoices \n"
"       (supported : Belgian Structured Communication Type).\n"
"    3) When the previous step doesn't find a match, the transaction "
"counterparty is \n"
"       located via the Bank Account Number configured on the OpenERP "
"Customer and \n"
"       Supplier records.\n"
"    4) In case the previous steps are not successful, the transaction is "
"generated \n"
"       by using the 'Default Account for Unrecognized Movement' field of "
"the CODA \n"
"       File Import wizard in order to allow further manual processing.\n"
"\n"
"In stead of a manual adjustment of the generated Bank Statements, you can"
" also \n"
"re-import the CODA after updating the OpenERP database with the "
"information that \n"
"was missing to allow automatic reconciliation.\n"
"\n"
"Remark on CODA V1 support:\n"
"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n"
"In some cases a transaction code, transaction category or structured \n"
"communication code has been given a new or clearer description in CODA "
"V2.The\n"
"description provided by the CODA configuration tables is based upon the "
"CODA \n"
"V2.2 specifications.\n"
"If required, you can manually adjust the descriptions via the CODA "
"configuration menu.\n"

"This application enables a group of people to intelligently and "
"efficiently manage leads, opportunities, meetings and phone calls.\n"
"\n"
"It manages key tasks such as communication, identification, "
"prioritization, assignment, resolution and notification.\n"
"\n"
"OpenERP ensures that all cases are successfully tracked by users, "
"customers and suppliers. It can automatically send reminders, escalate "
"the request, trigger specific methods and many other actions based on "
"your own enterprise rules.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest thing about this system is that users don't need to do "
"anything special. The CRM module has an email gateway for the "
"synchronization interface between mails and OpenERP. That way, users can "
"just send emails to the request tracker.\n"
"\n"
"OpenERP will take care of thanking them for their message, automatically "
"routing it to the appropriate staff and make sure all future "
"correspondence gets to the right place.\n"

"Web Context Tunnel.\n"
"===================\n"
"\n"
"The problem with OpenERP on_changes\n"
"-----------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"OpenERP uses to pass on_change Ajax events arguments using positional\n"
"arguments. This is annoying as modules often need to pass extra arguments"
"\n"
"that are not present in the base on_change signatures. As soon as two "
"modules\n"
"try to alter this signature to add their extra arguments, they are "
"incompatible\n"
"between them unless some extra glue module make them compatible again by\n"
"taking all extra arguments into account. But this leads to a "
"combinatorial\n"
"explosion to make modules compatible again.\n"
"\n"
"The solution\n"
"------------\n"
"\n"
"This module provides a simple work around that will work in most of the "
"cases.\n"
"In fact it works if the base on_change is designed to pass the context\n"
"argument. Else it won't work and you should go the old way. But in any "
"case\n"
"it's a bad practice if an on_change doesn't pass the context argument and"
" you\n"
"can certainly rant about these bad on_changes to the the context added in"
" the\n"
"arguments.\n"
"\n"
"So for an on_change passing the context, how does this module works?\n"
"\n"
"Well OpenERP already has an elegant solution for an extension module to "
"alter\n"
"an XML attributes: put an extension point in the view using\n"
"position=\"attributes\" and then redefine the attribute. That is already "
"used at\n"
"several places to replace the \"context\" attribute that the client will "
"send to\n"
"the server.\n"
"\n"
"The idea here is to wrap the extra arguments needed by your on_change "
"inside\n"
"that context dictionary just as it were a regular Python kwargs. That "
"context\n"
"should then be automatically propagated accross the on_change call chain,"
"\n"
"no matter of the module order and without any need to hack any on_change\n"
"signature.\n"
"\n"
"The issue with just position=\"attributes\" and redefining the context, "
"is that\n"
"again, if two independent modules redefine the context, they are "
"incompatible\n"
"unless a third module accounts for both of them.\n"
"\n"
"But with this module, an extension point can now use "
"position=\"attributes\" and\n"
"instead of redefining the \"context\" attribute, you will now just define"
" a new\n"
"\"context_foo\" attribute this way:\n"
"<attribute name=\"context_foo\">{'my_extra_field': "
"my_extra_field}</attribute>.\n"
"\n"
"This module modifies the web client in such a way that before sending the"
" Ajax\n"
"on_change event request to the server, all the node attributes starting "
"with\n"
"\"context\" are merged into a single context dictionnary, keeping the "
"keys and\n"
"values from all extensions. In the rare case a module really wants to "
"override\n"
"the value in context, then it needs to still override the original "
"context\n"
"attribute (or the other original attribute).\n"
"\n"
"And of course, if you should call your on_change by API or webservice "
"instead\n"
"of using the web client, simply ensure you are wrapping the required "
"extra\n"
"arguments in the context dictionary.\n"
"\n"
"Tests\n"
"-----\n"
"\n"
"This module comes with a simple test in static/test/context_tunnel.js.\n"
"To run it, open the page /web/tests?mod=web_context_tunnel in your "
"browser\n"
"as explained here https://doc.openerp.com/trunk/web/testing\n"
"It should also by picked by the Python testing when testing with "
"PhantomJS.\n"
"\n"
"As for testing modules using web_context_tunnel with YAML, yes it's "
"possible.\n"
"In fact you need to manually mimic the new web-client behavior by "
"manually\n"
"ensuring you add the extra context keys you will need later in your "
"on_change.\n"
